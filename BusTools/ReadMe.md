# Windows IoT Bus Tools

This folder contains tools that let you interact with GPIO, I2C, PWM, SPI, and UART on the command line. They will run on any edition of Windows, including [Windows 10 IoT Enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot/iot-enterprise/getting_started) and [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/windows-iot-core).

The tools are:
- GpioTestTool
- I2cTestTool
- PwmTestTool
- SpiTestTool
- MinComm (UART)

## Steps to Build the Project
1. Download [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

1. Select packages for C++, Windows UWP, and Windows Desktop app development.

Steps to follow:
 
(1)	After power on the Upboard, Press Del or F7 to enter the BIOS setting.
 
(2)	Under the "Boot -> OS Image ID" Tab:
    Select "Windows 10 IoT Core".
 
(3) Under the "Advance" Tab: Select "Hat Configuration" and make "I2C0/GPIO SELECTION" as "I2C0".
